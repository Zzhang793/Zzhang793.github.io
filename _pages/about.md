I am a 2nd-year PhD student at Oden Institute of Computational Science at UT-Austin, where I'm advised by Prof. [Omar Ghattas](https://users.oden.utexas.edu/~omar/) and Dr. [Umberto Villa](https://uvilla.github.io). I obtained my Bachelor degree in Applied Mathematics from University of Wisconsin Madison. 

I'm a member of the [Optimus](https://oden.utexas.edu/research/centers-and-groups/optimus/) (Optimization, Inversion, ML, and Uncertainty for Complex Systems) Research Group. My broad research interests are in the multidisciplinary fields of computational mathematics, data science, scientific machine learning with various applications in computational science and engineering (CSE). Specifically, I am interested in developing fast, scalable, and parallel computational methods for integrating data and models under high-dimensional uncertainty to make (1) statistical model learning via Bayesian inference, (2) reliable system prediction with uncertainty quantification, and (3) robust control and design by stochastic optimization.
Currently I'm working on data-driven prior modeling and  approximation of Hessian operator of general inverse problems.
